# Is Unique

## Problem
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique character. 
- What if you cannot use additional data structures?

## Solutions
There were three practical methods to approach this problem
- **Set:** Using allows for a single line function to determine whether the string was unique or not
- **Object:** Objects instant access allow for comparisons that when false can execute the function
- **No Structs:** This one requires an aasci array to act as map
