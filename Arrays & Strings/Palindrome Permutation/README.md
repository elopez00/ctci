# Palindrom Permutation

## Problem 
Given a string, write a function to check if it is purmuation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same fowards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palidnrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary wrods. You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.

## Solution
Because further inspection of a palindrome is determined by how many odd number of letters there are. If the string has more than
two odd letter counts then it would be impossible for the string to be a permutation of a palindrome
