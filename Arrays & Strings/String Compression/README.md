# String Compression

## Problem
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using counts of repeated characters. For example,
the stromg aanccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed string would not become smaller than the
origin string, your method would return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase
and lowercase letters (a-z).
