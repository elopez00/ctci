# URLify 

## Problem
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with `%20`. You may assume that the string has 
sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given `true` length
of the string. 

### Examples
**Input:** "Mr     John          Smith", 13
**Output:** "Mr%20John%20Smith"

## Solutions
- **Split/Join:** By using the split join functions, I am able to do this.
