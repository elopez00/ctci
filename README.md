# Cracking the Coding Interview

## Content
This repo contains problems and solutions to the *Cracking the Coding Interview* book by Gayle Larkman
McDonnel. Furthermore, the problems will be separated in sections and the goal is to solve and explain
each and everyone. All code will be written in JavaScript.

## Purpose
The purpose for me creating this repo is to practice and review data structures and algorithms and make
sure that I completely understand everything from the ground up.
